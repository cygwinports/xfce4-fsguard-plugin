ldesc: "The FSGuard panel plugin checks free space on a chosen mount 
point frequently and displays a message when a limit is reached.  There 
are two limits: a warning limit where only the icon changes, and an 
urgent limit that advise the user with a message.  The icon button can 
be clicked to open the chosen mount point."
